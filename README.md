AccountLab Plus was open sourced in December 2009 and was left to the community to maintain. It has since suffered a bit of neglect and is now a bit outdated. [jaalpu](https://github.com/jaalpu) made a lot changes and fixes to it around December 2013 and released version [2.9.2](https://github.com/jaalpu/AccountLab-Plus). It seems that he has since moved on, and appears that there isn't any active work being done to this project.

I plan on slowly bringing it back up to date. Such as adding new features, new frontend, new admin panel and just about everything else. If anyone else is interested in helping, feel free to!
