It was open sourced in December 2009 and left to the community to maintain.  It has suffered a bit of neglect since then, but it still mostly functional.  I can't bring myself to trust a closed source, SaaS, pay per month billing package, so I decided to make a few changes and breathe some life into this project.  I may not be very active but I hope someone finds my changes useful.
